During the hackathon I worked on converting Jeff's [Five Star Ratings Add-On](https://github.com/jpotts/alfresco-fivestar-ratings) to run on Alfresco Community 5.0.c using Alfresco SDK 2.0.

I had completed the Repo side work but still left with Share UI part as I am still learning AIKAU. If somebody in the community is willing to fork my project you may find it [here](https://github.com/sujaypillai/alfresco-fivestar-ratings) .
